# Assembly_C
Assembly and C programs. Mostly shellcode. 

• Spawn_shell = Shell-spawning code

• Port_bind = Port-binding code that spawns a shell

• Reverse_connect = Reverse-connecting code that spawns a shell

• Any code with "sc" = Shellcode


All shellcode is safe and does what it is supposed to do. Nothing less, nothing more.
